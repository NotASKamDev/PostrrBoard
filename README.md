# PostrrBoard: A Parody Social Media Site

The greatest thing since unsliced bread (or...yeah...)!

## Background

Enter Morgan Ronald (with an MBA): a successful* CEO that has led over thirty giant established corporations across a wide array of industries. Recently, Morgan Ronald (with an MBA) has decided to take a new leadership position at a tech startup, PostrrBoardSM, Inc. The brand has finally released version 1.0 of PostrrBoard.

PostrrBoard's shtick is that it's the exact opposite of its competitors like ~~Chirpiit~~ Y and Median. How is it different? It is explicitly designed to be LESS socially interactive.

```
"What?" - You
"Yes." - Bob, the sole developer/unpaid intern/sucker that has been given the task of creating this monstrosity
```

User content must be long, longer than a chirp. In millenial terms, this is three-cases of texting thumb. In Gen Z terms, this is 2x+ ACBPP(Attention-seeking, Cringe take, Brainrot Per Post)*.

Additionally, users can only interact with up to TEN posts per day. They are able to pick which ones by reading the first 100 characters (or a brief summary) of the post. They can also queue up posts for future reading.

*Does Gen Z even know how to chirp?
